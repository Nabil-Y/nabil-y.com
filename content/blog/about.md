## What I do

I'm a fullstack web developer who wants to build amazing web apps.

At first, I've studied applied physics 3 years to become an engineer but then changed my mind to find a new path.

In 2021, I discovered web dev and a passion was born. Soon after, I started the [**OpenClassrooms React Web App Developer**](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/516-developpeur-dapplication-javascript-react) class and got the degree.

Always looking to learn new things about software engineering.
